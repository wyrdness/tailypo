## Note on Oral Tradition

The Tailypo is primarily an **oral tradition** tale. Many "sources" are recordings or transcriptions of storytellers rather than original written texts. The story has been passed down through:
- Family storytelling
- Community gatherings
- Campfire traditions
- Regional folklore preservation efforts

Researchers should recognize that oral variants may differ significantly, and no single "authoritative" version exists.
