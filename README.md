## Overview

The Tailypo is a creature from Appalachian folklore, best known through a cautionary tale told throughout the American South. The story tells of a hunter who encounters a strange creature near his cabin. He manages to cut off the creature's tail, which he then cooks and eats.

That night, the creature returns, stalking around the cabin, scratching at the walls, and crying out *"Tailypo, tailypo, all I want is my tailypo."* Despite the hunter's dogs initially chasing it away, the creature returns night after night, growing bolder. The hunter's dogs eventually fail to protect him, and in most versions, the creature takes its revenge on the hunter, killing him.

The tale varies across Appalachia, with different endings and details, but the core message remains: **don't steal from nature, and respect creatures you don't understand.**

## The Story

### Traditional Narrative Structure

#### 1. The Hunt
A poor hunter living alone in a cabin deep in the Appalachian mountains is struggling to find food. One night, a strange creature enters his cabin or comes near it.

#### 2. The Theft
The hunter manages to cut off the creature's tail. Desperate for food, he cooks and eats the tail, finding it surprisingly good.

#### 3. The First Night
That night, the hunter hears scratching at his door and a strange voice crying:
> *"Tailypo, tailypo, all I want is my tailypo..."*

The hunter's dogs chase the creature away.

#### 4. The Second Night
The creature returns, scratching at the walls, crying out louder:
> *"Tailypo, tailypo, give me my tailypo!"*

The dogs chase it away again, but with more difficulty.

#### 5. The Third Night
The creature returns once more. This time the dogs cannot chase it away, or they have disappeared. The creature enters the cabin, confronting the hunter:
> *"Tailypo, tailypo, you got my tailypo!"*

#### 6. The Ending
In most versions, the creature kills the hunter in revenge. Some say if you go to that cabin today, you can still hear the creature's cry echoing through the mountains.
