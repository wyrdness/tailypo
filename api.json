      "full": "The Tailypo is a creature from Appalachian folklore, best known through a cautionary tale told throughout the American South. The story tells of a hunter who encounters a strange creature near his cabin. He manages to cut off the creature's tail, which he then cooks and eats. That night, the creature returns, stalking around the cabin, scratching at the walls, and crying out *\\\"Tailypo, tailypo, all I want is my tailypo.\\\"* Despite the hunter's dogs initially chasing it away, the creature returns night after night, growing bolder. The hunter's dogs eventually fail to protect him, and in most versions, the creature takes its revenge on the hunter, killing him. The tale varies across Appalachia, with different endings and details, but the core message remains: **don't steal from nature, and respect creatures you don't understand.**"
